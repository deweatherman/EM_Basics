# EM Basics

It is a personal repo containing Python based EM (Electromagnetics) code, useful for different scenarios: 

- Propagation
- EM coupling to transmission lines
- Multi-layer media
- Maybe some statics
- etc.

I have not really given a form to a final, applicable/usable library or package; however I hope to get there.

I am trying out [Vector](https://github.com/scikit-hep/vector), which is a library to describe vectors (physical sense, not arrays as sometimes this confusion apears). I also use Numpy, Scipy and maybe some Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing. Other libraries that might come handy are Network graph tools, such as Networkkit, Igraph, Graph-Tool, etc.) 

Goals are:
- Practise some coding practices
- Code Maintainability
- Open Science development: Open Source and Transparency

## "EM Basics" routines and parts

For now there is no higher level structure other than using classes that are extendable when possible. 
 

## Purpose of this repo

To gather publicly available theory and techniques that I like and I am personally interested in, and write them down into usable bits of code. 


## Documentation

For now we use the markdown standard for Jupyter Notebooks to document on-the-fly.
